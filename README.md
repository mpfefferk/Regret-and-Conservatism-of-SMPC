# Regret-and-Conservatism-of-SMPC
This repository contains the Matlab code corresponding to the demonstration of the regret and conservatism of a constrained stochastic model predicitve control algorithm where the performance loss associated with the lack of knowledge about the true distribution of the stochastic system uncertainties is quantified as regret.

**Associated Paper:** Maik Pfefferkorn, Venkatraman Renganathan and Rolf Findeisen, `Regret and Conservatism of Distributionally Robust Constrained Stochastic Model Predicitve Control`, Submitted to the IEEE Letters to Control Systems Society & American Control Conference, Toronto, Canada, 2024.

# Dependencies
- Matlab

# Procedure to run the code
Run the matlab code `Simulation.m` which will load the required system and controller data from the `Parameters.m` file and generates the desired plots.
